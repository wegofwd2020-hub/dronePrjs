# Session State — closedSpace

> Pickup point. Read this first when resuming work; it points at the
> four canonical sources for everything we know about the project.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-13
**Current phase:** observe (project ISA `phase: observe`, `progress: 6/44`)
**Roadmap:** Phase 0 complete — Phase 1 (MissionPlanner) is the next chunk.

---

## Start here, in this order

1. **`ISA.md`** — verifiable contract. 44 ISCs, 10 Features, full
   `## Decisions` log of every iteration (1 → 7). Frontmatter has
   `progress` and `phase`. **Read the most recent Decisions block
   first** — it's the freshest signal of what we just did.
2. **`docs/next-steps.md`** — 9-phase roadmap. Three open decisions
   (D1, D2, D3) gate Phase 3; phase 0 is unblocked and is the right
   first move on resume.
3. **`docs/use-cases.md`** — 9 use cases (UC-1 through UC-9), human-
   readable narrative tied back to ISA Features and ISCs.
4. **`docs/map-schema.md`** + **`docs/drones.md`** — the deep-dive
   companions for map data model and drone-platform survey.

## What's done

- Project ISA / PRD with 44 atomic ISCs, 10 Features.
- Warehouse map data model: schema doc, JSON Schema, reference fixture
  (64 capture positions).
- Map loader + validator implemented in Python: `closedSpace/map/`.
- Optional provenance fields (`surveyed_at`, `surveyed_by`) added in
  schema v1, threaded through loader, ISC-43 verified.
- pyproject.toml at project root with pytest config + deps declared.
- Use cases + roadmap + drone survey all written under `docs/`.
- **Phase 0 complete (2026-05-13):** git repo on GitHub, `.gitignore`,
  `.venv` + editable install, `engine/` skeleton (4 subpackages),
  `closedSpace.map.dump` (ISC-5 ✓), `Makefile` with `make all` green
  (ruff clean, mypy strict clean, 25 tests pass).

## What's open

- **D1**: sim-first vs hardware-first (recommended: sim-first).
- **D2**: simulator choice (recommended: two-tier — in-process
  kinematic now + Gazebo/PX4-SITL later).
- **D3**: flight stack (recommended: defer; `engine.flight_control`
  Protocol abstracts it).

## Suggested first move on resume

**Phase 1 — MissionPlanner** (~3–5 days). Implements the path-derivation
contract from `docs/map-schema.md` §10. Tasks NS-1.1 through NS-1.5 in
`docs/next-steps.md`; satisfies ISC-6 through ISC-10. Phase 1 has no
external decision dependency — D1/D2/D3 don't gate it.
